## `statements2csv.py`

This script converts bank statement PDFs from the banks I use, listed as
arguments, to plain text CSV on stdout. Example usage:

```zsh
$ ./statements2csv.py input1.pdf input2.pdf
,0,1,2,3,4
1,Date,Description,Daily Cash,,Amount
4,08/31/2021,Output Inc. 1418 N Spring St Los Angeles 90012 CA USA,1%,$0.10,$10.00
â€¦
```

Run `./statements2csv.py --help` for details. You can get a little more
debugging info by reducing the env var `LOGLEVEL`, which defaults to
`WARNING`.

My banks' official transaction search UIs suck. Mint stopped aggregating all my
bank transactions; its search was slow, besides. I save all my digital
statements anyway, for tax purposes. I figured, I can use fast grep on the
locally synced PDFs, instead of the official UIs. I can pipe to other Unix
commands. I can copy and paste to my spreadsheet software.
