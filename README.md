# taxes

Tasks for filing my taxes.

## Prerequisites

- [`git-crypt`](https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt)
- [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just)
- Python >=3.10

## Install

Make the commands listed in the next section available on your system with the
following.

```zsh
just install
```

### Decrypt

Some test input files in the repo are encrypted for privacy. If you know you
need them:

```zsh
git-crypt unlock
```

## Commands

### statements2csv

Convert bank statement PDFs from the banks I use, listed as arguments, to plain
text CSV on stdout.

Example usage:

```zsh
$ statements2csv input1.pdf input2.pdf
Date,Description,Amount
08/31/2021,Output Inc. 1418 N Spring St Los Angeles 90012 CA USA,$10.00
â€¦
```

Run `statements2csv --help` for more details. You can get a little more
debugging info by reducing the env var `LOGLEVEL`, which defaults to `WARNING`.

```zsh
$ LOGLEVEL=INFO statements2csv input1.pdf input2.pdf
```

#### Motivation

My banks' official transaction search UIs suck. I used to aggregate all my banks
with Mint, which started to lose data, and was shut down. Its search was slow,
besides. I save all my PDF statements anyway. I figured, I'm more comfortable in
the terminal. I can use fast grep on the locally synced PDFs (like
`greptransactions`, below), instead of the official UIs. I can pipe to other
Unix commands. I can copy and paste to my spreadsheet software.

### greptransactions (gt)

Grep CSV transactions for the given year and pattern.

Defaults to including only transactions from the previous calendar year.

Requires decrypted test input files. See above.

Example usage:

```sh
$ gt amazon | head -2
2022-02-08,Amazon.com*JQ87H3XZ3 Amzn.com/bill WA,4.34
2022-02-16,Amazon.com*5U8Z05QS3 Amzn.com/bill WA,51.13

$ gt --year 2021 amazon | head -2
2021-01-21,Amazon.com*T17O517I3 Amzn.com/bill WA,35.15
2021-03-03,Amazon.com*LJ4J51LF3 Amzn.com/bill WA,3.68
```

## Contribute

Install for local development:

```sh
just bootstrap
```

### Tests

```sh
just test
```

This skips tests that rely on decrypted files that are still encrypted. See
above how to decrypt test input files.

Besides tests, checks are run on commit, after installing the pre-commit hook
above, and on push. You can also run them manually.

```sh
just check
```
