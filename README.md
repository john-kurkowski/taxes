## statements2csv

This utility converts bank statement PDFs from the banks I use to plain text
CSV.

My banks' official transaction search UIs suck. Mint stopped aggregating all my
bank transactions; its search was slow, besides. I save all my digital
statements anyway, for tax purposes. I figured, I can use fast grep on the
locally synced PDFs, instead of the official UIs. I can pipe to other Unix
commands. I can copy and paste to my spreadsheet software.
